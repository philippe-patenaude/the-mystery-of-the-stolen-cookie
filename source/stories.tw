Science Boy blamed story
    One story can be to put chocolate chips in one of Science Boy's experiments. Then he can be blamed for stealing the cookie. To do this, you need to lure Grumpy Granny away from the break room. Once that is done, you need to look through the cabinets and take chocolate chips. Then you need to lure Science Boy out of the Lab. Finally, you need to put the chocolate chips in a vial and take the vial to the Security Officer Lady.

    How to lure Grumpy Granny away from the break room? Probably something to do with food and troublesome children.

    How to lure Science Boy away from his experiments in the lab? Maybe getting him to look for new resources or to look at something sciencey in another room (tesla coil? VR headset?).

Telling the twins apart
    One of the twins will ask you who she is. After you tell her, she will say you are wrong. You have to double down on saying who she is. If you do (and get it right), then you will get 1 reputation with each of the twins.

Jonah's (red bow) love potion (requires 1 reputation with Jonah)
    Jonah gets you to ask Science Boy to create a love potion. Once he creates the love potion, then you will give it to Jonah. Jonah will get you to secretly give it to him. Once Science Boy drinks the "love potion," he gets sick.

Add an option for the twins that doesn't make them angry and lets the player know which twin is which.

Can have the security officer lock the doors for a different reason than a cookie being stolen.

Can have mutually exclusive story lines. These can help with replayability.

Granny lure
    Mess with something that Granny has such as food or a coat.

Science boy lure
    Tell the science boy that there is a tesla coil in a different room.

You can interrogate people about the clues
    Who hid the cookies? (Grumpy Granny; she then forgot about them)
    Who left the muddy footprints in the security office and why? (Ninja Boy using a twin's shoes as a "distraction")
    Who left the cookie crumbs? (Grumpy Granny)
        You won't be able to investigate the kitchenette until Grumpy Granny is sent somewhere else.
    Who owned the coat? (Science Boy; couldn't wear the lab coat over his regular coat; left it on a skeleton)
    What is the thing?
